        This final project is a digital storytelling project that explores a fragment of Icelandic/Norse literature from Old Norse mythology, specifically the brief moment in the Prose Edda where Odin sacrifices his eye at Mímir’s well. Because this tale survives only in partial references and shifting translations, the project embraces its speculative nature rather than claiming a definitive retelling. Instead, it aims to reintroduce this ancient story to a modern audience through narrative, illustration, and web design.
        At its core, the project invites readers to reconnect with Scandinavian mythos and the wonder it inspires. In a time when stories are quickly consumed or reduced to trends, this site seeks to slow the pace and honor the depth, mystery, and cultural weight of Norse storytelling. While some artwork is original and some drawn from existing mythological sources, all visuals support the goal of preserving and celebrating a narrative tradition that is often overlooked yet still culturally resonant today.
